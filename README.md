# ðŸ’« Hi, I'm Vanessa!
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Biostatistics at Boston University. I recently discovered my passion for data analysis within the biological field and am aiming to contribute to healthcare using biostatistics. 

Previously, I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I worked as a Research Associate for two years, mainly conducting wet-lab research in biochemistry and microbiology.
